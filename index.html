                      navigate a very unique internal infrastructure, and do ad
                      hoc data digging. There is quite a bit of building things
                      purely to see how users will react (in in-person user
                      tests and A/B tests). I've learned much about the value

                      was a single-page app built in AngularJS. The back end was
                      a cluster of NodeJS servers that talked to PayPal services

                and realized, I didn't really understand quadtrees. It was
                pretty well-received! Non-programmer-, non-mathematics-types
                have told me they understood quadtrees after trying it.

                is Node bindings for Annoy, a popular Approximate Nearest
                Neighbors implementation in C++. The output of many machine
                learning processes is a lot of n-dimensional vectors
                representing things like words or songs. This Node module lets
                you use that kind output in JavaScript.

            Here are my main principles for building software:<br /><br />
            <ul>
              <li>
                Write tests. Write enough to easily tell if something is broken
                when you change it but not so much that the tests become a
                burden unto themselves. Change program code to be more testable
                instead of making tests extremely elaborate.
              </li>
              <li>
                Try to stick to code and tools you understand, even in
                third-party libraries. Sometimes, that can't be helped, but if
                you don't understand the code while you're building the feature,
                you will likely be forced to understand that code later—under
                pressure—while debugging a bug that made it to production.
              </li>
              <li>
                Make sure the code you're considering writing is actually
                necessary.
