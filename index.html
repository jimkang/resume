                        I worked on a team that builds voice experiences. I
                        built a kit that allows non-developers (designers and
                        researchers) to author full-featured voice prototypes,
                        which are web apps that enable users to speak to them.
                        The apps respond in kind with their own speech and
                        music, with the help of internal natural language
                        understanding and music intelligence technologies. Over
                        twenty prototypes have been built between July and
                        September of 2019. I've also built experimental features
                        for the iOS client.
